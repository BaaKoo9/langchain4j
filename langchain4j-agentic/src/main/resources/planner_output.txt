The user's request is about a medical issueâ€”breaking a leg. The medical agent is an expert in that area. But wait, maybe I should check if the request needs categorization first. The categorizeRequest agent could determine the right category, but since the user is directly asking for advice on a broken leg, maybe the medical agent is the best fit here. However, the instructions say to query all necessary agents. Wait, the user hasn't been categorized yet. Should I first categorize the request to determine which agent to use?

Let me check the available agents again. The categorizeRequest agent's description is to categorize the user request. The medical agent is for medical expertise. The user's request is a medical issue, so the categorizeRequest agent might not be necessary. Therefore, the next step is to call the medical agent.

3. **Apply Ice**: Apply ice wrapped in a cloth or an ice pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes every few hours during the first 48 hours. This can help reduce swelling and pain.

4. **Elevate the Leg**: Try to keep your leg elevated above heart level when you are sitting or lying down, which can also help with reducing swelling.

5. **Pain Management**: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may be taken according to the instructions on the label to manage pain and inflammation.
